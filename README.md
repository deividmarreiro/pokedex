# Pokedex

This project is a Pok√©dex developed as part of my studies in **React** with **TypeScript**. The base design was taken from this [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/community/file/979132880663340794), created by **Ricardo Schiniegoski**. 

Although I made some adjustments to the design to meet my project needs, all rights to the original design remain with the author.

## Project Objective

The main goal of this project was to consolidate my knowledge of React and TypeScript. Additionally, it served as an opportunity to work with a professional design and adapt it to the required functionalities.

## Usage and Inspiration

If you wish to use this project as a base or inspiration for your own projects, feel free! Just remember to give proper credit to the original design and this repository, if applicable.
